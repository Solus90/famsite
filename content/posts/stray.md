<p class="italic text-sm text-white">Reviewed on PS5 by Trevor</p>
<p class="text-md text-white">Games don’t tend to shy away from having an animal lead, but Stray has to be the most realistic one yet, complete with napping, scratching, and knocking shit off the ledge. </p>

<p class="text-md text-white">In this adventure platformer, you play as a cat exploring the neon-lit slums of a forgotten city, trying to find your way back home. The puzzles and platforming themselves are simple, but satisfying, and evolve enough while playing that the gameplay never felt stale. The mysteries of this world and its inhabitants were something I couldn’t get enough of. I found myself going away from the main objective just to see what I could uncover about the world and was almost always rewarded for doing so. What surprised me the most in my 4-hour journey with the game, was its ability to tell a compelling, and surprisingly emotional, story without the protagonist ever saying a word. </p>

<p class="text-md text-white">Stray goes well beyond what could have just been a gimmick and has given us one of the best games this year has to offer.</p>
